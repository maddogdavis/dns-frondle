A tool for deploying named (bind) configuration and zone files to a set
of DNS servers.  The idea being that a DNS configuration for one or many
zones should be under version control.  The act of deploying any change
to a DNS configuration is orchestrated by this tool.

The tool itself has the following usage:

    $ dns-frondle
    usage: dns-frondle <git-repo> dns-server [dns-server ...]

With example:

    $ dns-frondle git@github.com:/maddogdavis/dns.git spud gun fire

Where {spud,gun,fire} are DNS servers either internal or out in the wild
internet.

There are 5 distinct parts to the execution:

    1. Ensure SSH access to each of the listed DNS servers.

    2. Checkout the git repo locally.

    3. Upload the git repo to each of the listed DNS servers.

    4. Switch the live BIND link on each of the listed DNS servers.

    5. Poke each of the DNS servers using "rndc reload".

Every execution of dns-frondle creates a unique, timestamped area on each of
the DNS servers.  Each area contains the git commit id in its name.
